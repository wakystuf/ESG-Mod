  <!-- Cravers -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust1CraversTitle">Xenobiological Incentives</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust1CraversDescription">Divided between cold and disinterested masters and their slaves, Craver society can offer few incentives to its denizens. However, by exploiting luxuries as a reward for collaborators and additives for the main Craver population, a profitable system of incentives can still be achieved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood2CraversTitle">Alternative Food Programs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood2CraversDescription">Both Cravers and their victims long ago realized that eating the labor force was not a good long term plan, and so food growing programs were created to take advantage of a planets natural biosphere for more efficient and sustainable fueling of the war machine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementBuyout1CraversTitle">Expendable Dust Expertise</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementBuyout1CraversDescription">Dust-empowered individuals are few and far between, but not too difficult to find during the food conversion process. By removing both Craver and conquered from the population when these talents show themselves, we can maintain an elite Dust labor force who shall live short, but significantly more pleasant lives until the construction efforts burn them out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence1CraversTitle">Conquest Announcement Networks</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence1CraversDescription">Cravers and their slaves derive little joy from the empires progress, but by hooking the former into a mental network and giving the latter constant updates from screens and speakers, every achievement can heighten the excitement of the Cravers and beat down the hope of their victims in real-time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence2CraversTitle">Body Language Programming</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence2CraversDescription">By obtaining other factions guides to diplomacy and facial recognition databases, we can create Craver specialists programmed to identify and exploit not only the emotional responses of other factions, but also of conquered populations who might be more amenable to the carrot or the stick at any moment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience6CraversTitle">Evolutionary Analysis Pens</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience6CraversDescription">One of the limits of natural evolution is that it cannot handle large changes well, as species are wiped out by disasters or predators which are too great a difference for them - Predators like the Cravers. By setting aside entire continents to only ever be attacked by Craver scouts and raiding parties that they can just about handle, we can observe our own weaknesses in an arena where our economy of scale will not obscure the results.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence3CraversTitle">Intergalactic Hostages</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence3CraversDescription">By establishing "foreign exchange" arrangements with allies and offering hits of Dust-9 to famous figures in other empires, the Cravers can offer significant incentives to foreign politicians as an incentive to collaborate, and the threat of punishing famous prisoners and entire populations of their distant relatives as a convenient threat to prevent war without ruining the reputation of said politicians at home.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry5CraversTitle">Hazardous Mining Hives</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry5CraversDescription">Through intense experimentation, we have created an offshoot of the Craver species whose birth is caused by the chemical triggers of valuable strategic resources. Cheap, tough, and tireless, these worker drone hives are well suited to the most dangerous of environments.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScienceOnGasCraversTitle">Collaborative Research Academies</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScienceOnGasCraversDescription">While it is dangerous to allow educated members of the empire and its victims such unrestricted access to one another, giving scientists and their families exemption from hard labor in return for working with Craver scientists can prove a boon, especially when provided with expendable Craver assistants which will not complain about radiation or experimentation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust7CraversTitle">Dust-Consuming Collectors</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust7CraversDescription">By putting a new variety of cheap, expendable Dust-consuming Cravers under the command of regular Cravers with a mastery of Dust, we can mine vast amounts of it at extremely low cost using these self-sustaining mini-hives of hungerless workers and clairvoyant overseers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience8CraversTitle">Aerial Drone Deployments</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience8CraversDescription">Cravers are a heavy species, not least due to being cyborgs, and that can make life on a gas giant more difficult. While they are no longer recognizable as Cravers and make the rest of their species uncomfortable, prefab hives of dormant aerial drones can be deployed to harvest and explore these worlds as though they were native to the environment.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Sophons -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience4SophonsTitle">Anti-Radiation Campuses</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience4SophonsDescription">While the Sophons are generally are interested in using the most cutting edge technology in the development of their labs with the expectation that advanced tools will beget more advanced tech, in the matter of laboratory radiation shielding they are traditionalists, constructing sprawling underground campuses modeled off of the steam cave communities of Hekim to accommodate entire towns of researchers and their families.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Riftborn -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry1TimeLordsTitle">Hadeo-Industrial Infrastructure</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry1TimeLordsDescription">There's a time and place for everything, but the time and place for metallurgy is immediately and on the hottest planets we can find. By setting up industrial-scale forges on planets already hot enough to melt metal using only its hellish atmospheric forces, industrial manufacturing can run at breakneck speeds. While there are small inefficiencies with the materials the factories are made out of melting, the gains far outweight the costs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience1TimeLordsTitle">Glacial-Sanitization Laboratories</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience1TimeLordsDescription">While sanitization is always important when studying biology, advances in xenobiology have uncovered new ways of perfectly sterilizing equipment to reduce any chance of contamination. The downside? This only works on planets with temperatures far below most would consider habitable, but the research applications are too good to ignore.</LocalizationPair>
