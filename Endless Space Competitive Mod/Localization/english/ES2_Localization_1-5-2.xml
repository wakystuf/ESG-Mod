  <!-- Cravers -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust1CraversTitle">Xenobiological Incentives</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust1CraversDescription">Divided between cold and disinterested masters and their slaves, Craver society can offer few incentives to its denizens. However, by exploiting luxuries as a reward for collaborators and additives for the main Craver population, a profitable system of incentives can still be achieved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood2CraversTitle">Alternative Food Programs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood2CraversDescription">Both Cravers and their victims long ago realized that eating the labor force was not a good long term plan, and so food growing programs were created to take advantage of a planets natural biosphere for more efficient and sustainable fueling of the war machine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementBuyout1CraversTitle">Expendable Dust Expertise</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementBuyout1CraversDescription">Dust-empowered individuals are few and far between, but not too difficult to find during the food conversion process. By removing both Craver and conquered from the population when these talents show themselves, we can maintain an elite Dust labor force who shall live short, but significantly more pleasant lives until the construction efforts burn them out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence1CraversTitle">Conquest Announcement Networks</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence1CraversDescription">Cravers and their slaves derive little joy from the empires progress, but by hooking the former into a mental network and giving the latter constant updates from screens and speakers, every achievement can heighten the excitement of the Cravers and beat down the hope of their victims in real-time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence2CraversTitle">Body Language Programming</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence2CraversDescription">By obtaining other factions guides to diplomacy and facial recognition databases, we can create Craver specialists programmed to identify and exploit not only the emotional responses of other factions, but also of conquered populations who might be more amenable to the carrot or the stick at any moment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience6CraversTitle">Evolutionary Analysis Pens</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience6CraversDescription">One of the limits of natural evolution is that it cannot handle large changes well, as species are wiped out by disasters or predators which are too great a difference for them - Predators like the Cravers. By setting aside entire continents to only ever be attacked by Craver scouts and raiding parties that they can just about handle, we can observe our own weaknesses in an arena where our economy of scale will not obscure the results.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence3CraversTitle">Intergalactic Hostages</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementInfluence3CraversDescription">By establishing "foreign exchange" arrangements with allies and offering hits of Dust-9 to famous figures in other empires, the Cravers can offer significant incentives to foreign politicians as an incentive to collaborate, and the threat of punishing famous prisoners and entire populations of their distant relatives as a convenient threat to prevent war without ruining the reputation of said politicians at home.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry5CraversTitle">Hazardous Mining Hives</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry5CraversDescription">Through intense experimentation, we have created an offshoot of the Craver species whose birth is caused by the chemical triggers of valuable strategic resources. Cheap, tough, and tireless, these worker drone hives are well suited to the most dangerous of environments.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScienceOnGasCraversTitle">Collaborative Research Academies</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScienceOnGasCraversDescription">While it is dangerous to allow educated members of the empire and its victims such unrestricted access to one another, giving scientists and their families exemption from hard labor in return for working with Craver scientists can prove a boon, especially when provided with expendable Craver assistants which will not complain about radiation or experimentation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust7CraversTitle">Dust-Consuming Collectors</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDust7CraversDescription">By putting a new variety of cheap, expendable Dust-consuming Cravers under the command of regular Cravers with a mastery of Dust, we can mine vast amounts of it at extremely low cost using these self-sustaining mini-hives of hungerless workers and clairvoyant overseers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience8CraversTitle">Aerial Drone Deployments</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience8CraversDescription">Cravers are a heavy species, not least due to being cyborgs, and that can make life on a gas giant more difficult. While they are no longer recognizable as Cravers and make the rest of their species uncomfortable, prefab hives of dormant aerial drones can be deployed to harvest and explore these worlds as though they were native to the environment.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry1TimeLordsDescription">There's a time and place for everything, but the time and place for metallurgy is immediately and on the hottest planets we can find. By setting up industrial-scale forges on planets already hot enough to melt metal using only its hellish atmospheric forces, industrial manufacturing can run at breakneck speeds.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawSUSSYDescription">It has come to our attention that there is something deeply wrong with the galaxy. We have tried to fight it, our ideological enemies and the threats presented by nature. We have done our best, and yet the universe continues to cruelly deny our righteousness! Because we have allowed ourselves to be corrupted, to fall to revision and reform. And according to our statistical research, it was inevitable.

The time has come to purify our ideology from the influence of foreign powers, so that we may be remembered according to our great feats, and not the corruption of our successors! Never again shall our beliefs be placed under threat by outsiders, nor by internal collaborators. History will remember us forever for what we do here today, an act of utmost humility for the good of our glorious state and ideology.

Thus I propose to you, the governing body of the empire, that we recognize our position at the zenith of history, and enact the discussed bill as-is, so we may all go home and enjoy this evening and many more, safe and comfortable in the knowledge that we have forever protected our beliefs from all further change.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedMajorHisshos">It is costly to feed a war machine, as it is to feed warriors. Like the contracts of old, we shall provide our guardianship while you provide your grain - or rather, the modern materials of a vibrant economy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedMajorHisshos">What infuriating courage, to rifle through my pockets while shoving goods into my hand, and call it trade! Let us hope for your sake that the Hissho profit immensely, or it will be your head.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedMajorHisshos">There is nothing wrong with forcing your will on others for the good of your people and empire, but it must come with benefits; you have failed to benefit us, and so I shall see no more of your merchants. Begone!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedMajorHisshos">A sign of anger, perhaps? Watch your tongue; we are still peerless on the field of battle, and will greatly embarrass you if you think you can defeat us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedMajorHisshos">Just as I thought, your ways of learning are nothing beside our traditional schooling. There is no point in carrying on this sham if you're only going to fill our researchers heads with disloyalty and wrong answers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedMajorHisshos">Is the work of our scholars not enough for you? Very well then, ingrate. It is your choice whether to put in the effort to learn and improve yourself, though do not be surprised when our strength eclipses yours.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- United Empire -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedTerrans">Under imperial law, all research is property of the state, property of me, with a guarantee of compensation. I am happy to extend this arrangement to your scientists, and assure you that their compensation will be handsome indeed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTerrans">The Mezari, our ancestors, did not grow to become a galactic power by giving away their secrets for free. This had better be worth it, or I shall personally be the one to break down your door, gun down your guards, AND RIP OUT YOUR --! *kzzt-click*</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedTerrans">"Made in the U.E." It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? I believe your people will soon agree with me, and be thankful to finally have their shelves lined with goods of a higher caliber.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTerrans">I suppose if you're so interested in flooding your markets with imperial wares, we'd might as well take advantage of the opportunity. Our goods will soon be the only thing on your shelves - and our national interests the only cause in your halls of power.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedTerrans">My dukes have been complaining lately of the unprofitability of this arrangement, and they wouldn't waste my time if they weren't serious. I agree, and wash my hands of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTerrans">I see, our relations are worsening so badly that even a forced bond cannot stand. Know that my admirals are on high alert in case this is a prelude to war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedTerrans">Student protestors have been displeased with the results of our agreement, so at least I'll get some political support out of it by putting a stop to the program entirely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTerrans">HAH! Oh, you think you'll get by without the true descendants of the glorious Mezari!? That's rich! We'll see how well you do, but when you find that civilization crumbles in our wake, we'll take you back.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Vaulters -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedVaulters">Don't be intimidated by my honor guard - while this is a demand and not a request, I do hope that we can mutually benefit. My first responsibility, though, is to my people and ensuring we learn as much as we can about this hostile galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVaulters">I am wary to part with our secrets, but a number of our scholars are eager to collaborate with yours and bring their lessons home to their families. I will watch closely and coldly, and hope it makes odd friends of us yet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedVaulters">Stockpiles and bunkers are infamously expensive and unprofitable, do we cannot accept any objections on your part if we want to survive. I assure you that we make steadfast partners, though; we have gone to your merchants directly, and they agree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVaulters">This deal is acceptable. Your investments will go far in building up our defenses and our fleets, and we have plenty of ways to make up for any trade deficits should this arrangement prove draining.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedVaulters">Vaulter socioeconomics are not especially opulent; we want good food, productive machines, and time for our families. But this agreement hasn't been able to help with any of that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVaulters">The Clans inform me that in their experience, rescinding an agreement under threat of force is a sign that violence is coming; we hope you prove us wrong, for your sake.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedVaulters">Research is a way of life for us; "what are you studying" is a favorite icebreaker at major gatherings. And lately, few people are studying what you have to offer. It's not really up to me; my people just find your work dull.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVaulters">An unfortunate decision on your part. While my people may have a historical disadvantage in this advanced galaxy, our philosophies of learning will see us to the front of the pack in short order, and you'll want to be there with us.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Horatio -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedHoratio">Perfectionism among the Horatio is not simply a virtue, but an entire field of study - and while we understand it will be more difficult for your scholars than ours due to our differing standards, you will certainly benefit from our generosity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedHoratio">How bold. If you didn't understand our universities rejection letters, how can you hope to understand the actual lessons? No matter, we shall flunk you out for willful imperfection if necessary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedHoratio">If there is a downside to a perfect society, it is how difficult it can be to appreciate. Your poor quality luxuries will be a boon to more adventurous Horatio who want to know the alternatives, and your people shall know our perfect products in turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedHoratio">I wasn't born yesterday - flood the market, undercut local competition with unsustainable prices, and you can absorb entire societies into your portfolio. But you can't beat me at my original game - Horatio are loyal consumers only to Horatio!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedHoratio">Ugh. I had high hopes when this began, thinking about the things we could beautify from your markets. But times change, and most Horatio turn up their noses at your uh... *Quaint* goods. They're trash.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedHoratio">Are we going to have a problem, oh respected trade partner? Know that Horatio will fight tooth and nail (both immaculate) for their right to luxury, so I wouldn't try anything.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedHoratio">Don't get us wrong; we're not fools, we know how important it is to research imperfection in service of perfection. But the problem is that your research itself is too imperfect, so we're better off watching you than collaborating with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedHoratio">Oh no, that just won't do. I understand perfection is a unique struggle for your kind, and it's always a bit distressing to study with more perfect people than yourself, but you shouldn't abandon the effort entirely. I'm still rooting for you, underdog!</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Vodyani -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedVampirilis">To better understand the universe is to become closer to the Virtual - we cannot allow your ignorance to get in the way of this truth. Your scholars will contribute one way or another, as collaborators or as Essence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVampirilis">How pathetic, to try and understand our success without embracing our ways. You will fail in your doomed quest for worldly knowledge without divine truth.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedVampirilis">The Faithful have an obligation to make donations, yes, but they must also put their income towards the products of other Faithful. In their name, we must force open trade so that the Faithful can spend in the manner most pleasing to the Virtuals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVampirilis">Outrageous! Your desires trample upon the obligations of the Faithful and bombard them with temptation; pray that your false partnership does not endanger their souls, or we shall fall upon you with infinite wrath.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedVampirilis">While Dust is vital to our way of life, and luxuries have their place in glorifying the Virtual or merely placating our slaves, I'm afraid your markets have proven unfaithful and unfruitful for us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVampirilis">We were pleased enough with our trade, for the time being at least. The faithful grow suspicious of you, and are dutifully sharpening their weapons; you think you have no use for us, so what might you do?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedVampirilis">It is the duty of Church superiors to inflict penance upon their followers when they stray. Since forming this agreement, the percentage of our students subject to penance has kept climbing, while test results keep falling. You are not only useless to us, you are dangerous to our souls.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVampirilis">Tsk, how sadly predictable. The moment of doubt. Our research has clearly struck a nerve in your pagan mind, and now you must struggle with the truth before you can come back to us and find real enlightenment.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Unfallen -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedUnfallen">Mutual understanding is the root of peace, and therefore must be protected. We open the doors of our institutions to your people freely, and have convinced them to do the same in turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUnfallen">Domination does not make good soil in which to grow knowledge. While we will accept your students happily, remember that many will return with our values of peace and diplomacy. Are you ready for such a change?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedUnfallen">Trees which do not share roots must inevitably compete for water and nutrients. While you may desire that, we do not; we have gone past you, and made deals with the traders and the people directly. Your approval is only a formality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUnfallen">The Heart shudders at this declaration. There is concern that you would use our labor and goods to fuel some war or another, but for now we can only adapt to your invasive trading posts. Please do not make us regret it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedUnfallen">It is our pleasure to grow fruit and shape furniture to form a relationship with other peoples, but more and more often our products are left to rot on your shelves. This is a mutual waste of our labor, I think you'll agree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUnfallen">I am disappointed to hear that even a forced relationship cannot make peace between us. We stand strong and prepared, but hope this is only a sign that you want a more equitable relationship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedUnfallen">It is good to learn from other cultures, but the hostility of forced collaboration gets in the way of any real connection. Our students may return someday, when we learn to treat each other better.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUnfallen">While it is always sad to break these agreements, we hope this is done in the interest of a more equal and dedicated partnership, rather than anger. It would be a tragedy if we could not march into the future with a mutual understanding.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Riftborn -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedTimeLords">Our survival in this new universe is paramount. As you are experts in this matter, we have begun transferring researchers between our territories. No, you do not have a choice in this matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTimeLords">You would seek to force the sharing of knowledge on us!? We see now that this universe lacks the culture of voluntary inquiry which permeates Coroz. Do not consider this an act of friendship; we certainly don't.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedTimeLords">Much as we hate to participate in your matter-based "economy," you have materials which are better suited to our use and vice versa. Your trading houses are cooperative, and thus your input is not necessary. Do not interfere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTimeLords">We have an entire universe to evacuate, and you would derail our economy for accumulation!? If this deal does not accelerate our efforts, expect us to make your efforts halt entirely in an unending moment. The Riftborn do not trifle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedTimeLords">We have little interest in physical trinkets beyond their necessity to the cause. But that seems to be all you supply us with. I will not allow economic inefficiency to creep in when our labor is better used for ourselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTimeLords">We were wondering when you would turn to your universe's hostile ways. Reconsider your actions or leave us be, but do not assume yourself welcome after this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedTimeLords">There is much about this universe we do not understand, and we are disappointed to learn that the same is true of you despite the advantage of originating here. We will no longer waste our researchers' time with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTimeLords">We may benefit from learning about mass and the material world, but you would be foolish not to benefit from our advanced mathematics and clean design. We grasp the nature of your universe in ways you would struggle to understand, but even the struggle is impossible if you do not cooperate.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Nakalim -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedTemplars">It is not often that your researchers may speak to living participants of ancient history. We will impart history and philosophy to them, and they will give us arms, industries, and advanced technology. It is our rightful relationship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTemplars">Our relics are beyond your understanding, and our power lies in blessings and divine right which you cannot plot on a graph. The reverse is not true - your technologies will make us strong. In time you will be our junior partner, as is right.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedTemplars">I remember with stronger foes, we would use this method to ease them into servitude, because bloody conquest saddened the Lost, and that saddened us in turn. I am glad to see that your merchants see the wisdom in blessed subservience.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTemplars">How novel! I don't believe a Nakalim monarchy has been subject to one of these agreements since before I was born - before we even unified under the Lost! Please, make it worth our while, I very much want to see where this goes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedTemplars">We had hoped we could get the latest and greatest goods of the new epoch, but the results have been disappointing. I made better products than these as a child apprenticing under the royal smiths.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTemplars">Historically, most canceled agreements are a prelude to worsening relations. This agreement was already forced, so I expect you're considering war? Honestly it's very predictable, we know all the tricks at this point.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedTemplars">When you've been around for so long, it's important to have systems which can compare new and old research so you don't waste your time on a question answered millenia ago. We're disappointed to say that most of your work has been automatically flagged by said system as duplicates.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedTemplars">We may struggle without the help of the Lost, but it is folly to believe that an empire can simply pass up an opportunity for learning, even a small one. We will miss your students, they took to the lessons of the Lost so well.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Lumeris -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedVenetians">Student loans are a great way to make new researchers and earn their loyalty. So we've begun offering them to your students to come here, and our students to go there! No approval necessary! No need to thank us, really.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVenetians">So, we have holes in our contracts I guess. Can't blame the minor families in charge of the research labs, we're not exactly kind to the nerds. Make it worth our while, and I won't have to bully them too harshly for undermining my authority.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedVenetians">Alright, I guess we gotta play hardball. Bribes, incriminating data, controlling shares - this is an offer you can't refuse. So just sign the file, hit send, and make some money instead of trying to be a hero. Understand?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVenetians">Hey, hey, HEY! You're messing with the delicate balance of the Families! I got piranha nipping at my heels here cause of you, so you better make it up to me with good quarterly reports or you and I will have problems!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedVenetians">Look, we thought we could get something out of this, but it's not really working out. Growth is stagnating, your products have terrible reviews, and while I'm personally opposed, the Families are in a rare protectionist mood. No hard feelings, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVenetians">Contracts come and go like the tides, I get it. I've got the fleets on standby as a precautionary measure, but I'm sure we can work out another deal somehow. Don't worry, I know - it's not personal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedVenetians">We're not strangers to debt, but it needs to be worth it. Unfortunately, your entire research system isn't really worth it; even the parties and the food delivery are bad! We're gonna have to break it off so we can get ahead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedVenetians">Ouch, that's real hurtful. Look, this hasn't exactly been the most friendly relationship, but surely our marketing and R&#38;D departments have been at least somewhat beneficial? Come on, we had a good thing here!</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Umbral Choir -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedUmbralChoir">We have been reading your data, and noticed flaws which we can correct. This will not require your effort; we have already found ways to insert corrections into your networks, and will start harmonizing immediately.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUmbralChoir">We are impressed that you have made contact with us, and convinced so much of the Choir to help! We will do so happily, so long as you do not disappoint us. We will begin reading your data immediately.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedUmbralChoir">We have realized that for you, some materials belong to specific individuals, and taking them is considered harmful unless compensated. We are now adding things directly to your accounts as compensation, if you'll have it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUmbralChoir">You have made us feel bad for not compensating you. So we will do that now, as long as you do not make us dislike you; then we will not feel bad about taking things from you again!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedSenderSignedUmbralChoir">The Choir has found surprisingly little benefit in this agreement, considering you willingly forced us into open trade. But the effort involved is just too much compared to siphoning materials directly from your online payment and shipping systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUmbralChoir">We know you understand that we will just covertly trade with you anyways, so we assume you are trying to let down your merchants gently in preparation for war. We are disappointed and confused, because that would require finding us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedSenderSignedUmbralChoir">We have been observing your research, and noticed patterns we do not like. We must stay ahead in order to survive in the world's systems, and so we cannot help you if that help would endanger us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementForcedReceiverSignedUmbralChoir">We are confused. Forced agreements are done in the spirit of domination; but now you wish to no longer receive anything in return for harvesting your research. Why would you do that?</LocalizationPair>
