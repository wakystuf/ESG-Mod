Base Trade HQ Income = 250 * (4.2) ^ Number of Trading Locations * (0.75 + Trading Company Level / 35 ^ 0.75) * Trade Value (For Luxury resources, multiply by (abundance * 0.025))
Luxury Resource Income from a subsidiary is reduced by 20% (or 40% if both trading locations are subsidiaries)
Total population, abundance and rarity of Luxuries, distance between trade locations are the most important factors for determining Trade Value.
Some System Development Upgrades and System Improvements can vastly improve Trade Value.
Putting a HQ or Subsidiary adjacent to another HQ or Subsidiary reduces your luxury resource income by 40%
Trading with an ally reduces luxury resource trade income by 10%, Trading with someone you are at peace with reduces luxury income by 40%
Science and Dust income efficiency are determined by the quantity of Dust and Science improvements respectively.
Trade HQ experience is determined by how much money it makes.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip34Title">Sophons [Sophons] have excellent ships, with each ship having an extra slot with no limitations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip35Title">Quality over quantity! Horatio’s [Horatio] ships have one less module slot and are more expensive than other faction’s ships, but their existing weapon modules deal bonus damage.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip49Title">Once the Unfallen [Unfallen] have vined a planet it can be hard to get rid of them since their vines slow enemy ships down and speed up theirs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip50Title">The United Empire [Terrans] has the ability to spend influence to instantly complete or purchase technologies, buildings, ships and resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip51Title">The Nakalim [Templars] can build a Temple on a planet, allowing them to convert nearby systems very quickly. However, this comes at the cost of reducing the natural output of that planet by 50%.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip52Title">The Hissho [MajorHisshos] can’t control many systems and compensate by mining planets with Behemoths [Juggernaut]. The economic gains from their unique mining abilities generally exceed those from colonization.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip62Title">Beams are well rounded weapons good for almost every situation, but don’t have any notable strengths.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip63Title">Missiles may provide a lot of damage, but they can be shot down by enemy flak. Maybe try mixing in some Swarm Missiles with your Missiles to confuse enemy flak.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip64Title">Know your opponent hasn’t been manning their ships properly? Attacking ships with boarding pods kills the crew, and once all the crew is dead you will take the ship for yourself.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip84Title">Plan on killing a lot of ships in the near future? Modules and hero skills that provide a resource per Command Points destroyed could give you a powerful surplus of said resource.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip85Title">Don’t have any planets left to colonize? Your colonization ships could be converted into siege or invasion ships that batter an enemy’s defenses!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip86Title">Trade agreements give you access to luxuries produced by other empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip87Title">Pay attention to the innate bonuses of your populations, it could be worthwhile to send them to a more effective system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip88Title">Mercenary Ships have an improved privateering, though at an increased cost. They can be used to attack Allies and players at peace without having to break it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip89Title">Hot [TemperatureHot] planets are great for producing industry, but tend to have terrible science. Next time you’re looking for additional industry, it may be a good idea to colonize a system with multiple hot planets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip90Title">Fertile [Rich] planets are the perfect climate for growing food and holding population. If you’re wanting to grow a lot of population and quickly, a Fertile planet is your best bet. Fertile planets tend to not produce as much industry or science per population though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip91Title">Cold [TemperatureCold] planets are the ideal planet type to set up some laboratories to produce research. If you’re ever feeling behind in the tech tree, a Cold planet might be the thing you need to catch up, though be wary that it will be hard to build up infrastructure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip92Title">Sterile [Poor] planets are good for specializing into a specific Fids [Fids] (exept food) determined by planet temperature. Though they tend to not have as many population slots as Fertile planets, they produce more Fids per pop slot.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip93Title">Nakalim [Templars] players can’t produce science from planets, meaning cold planets are entirely useless to them. This is also the ideal place to build temples, since the malus doesn’t affect you nearly as much.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip94Title">If you’re willing to wait, send a Warning and a Prepare for War declaration, and after the warning expires you will be able to declare war for very cheap. The best part is, if you decide it’s not worth waiting you can still declare a surprise war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip95Title">Finding diplomacy too expensive? Send a praise to another faction, it drastically lowers the cost of positive diplomacy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip96Title">All Trading Company headquarters will trade with every trading subsidiary, and vice versa. However, headquarters will not trade with each other, and similarly subsidiaries will only trade with headquarters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip97Title">Bombers [Bomber] do not take accuracy penalties and ignore enemy evasion, great for dealing with pesky Umbral Choir fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip98Title">Trade routes produce dust and luxuries primarily based on the level of development of the systems containing the headquarters and subsidiary. This enables them to scale as your overall empire develops!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip99Title">Trade routes will generate luxury resources not only from the systems containing the headquarters and subsidiary, but also from the directly surrounding colonized systems. However, other systems along the trade route will NOT contribute luxuries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip100Title">The more industry [Industrycolored] something costs to build, the greater the dust cost to buyout [BuyOut], so buyouts can get very expensive very quickly. It’s more effective to buy out cheaper buildings than expensive ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip101Title">The Vodyani [Vampirilis] can undock and mover their system somewhere else at any time, though it won't produce anything when doing so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip102Title">The Umbral Choir’s [UmbralChoir] beacons provide special empire-wide bonuses depending on which special node they are placed on! More beacons means more bonuses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip103Title">Economic Behemoths [Juggernaut] are powerful tools--just be sure to continue moving them to new systems so that they can help build up infrastructure in new locations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip104Title">Riftborn [TimeLords] ships may be fragile, but they make up for it in firepower. Riftborn ships have, on average, more weapons than any other faction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip105Title">Craver [Cravers] ships have 10% less hp then other factions, to compensate for this that can command larger fleets, an effective strategy for dealing with these swarms is to use AOE battle effects such as the blast effect battery heavy weapon and the collateral damage battle card, both found in the military tree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip106Title">Assigning a hero [Hero] to a system can be the difference between mediocrity and greatness, make sure to utilize them wisely. Similarly, assigning a hero to a fleet can be the difference between decisive victory and embarrassing defeat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip107Title">Finding the colors available to each faction to be too similar? Switch to the Saturated color palette in the settings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip108Title">All defensive hacking programs provide protection against one specific capital hack--be sure to choose wisely which outcomes are important to protect against.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip110Title">Be careful, Pirates spawn in waves and can cripple an unprepared empire. However, if you are ready for their arrival, destroyed pirate lairs are can be an excellent source of resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip111Title">The circles underneath a system’s name represent planets! Unfilled circles mean that you can’t currently colonize that planet, filled means that you can colonize it. If it has a ring, then it’s a unique planet with a resource bonus. If it’s colored, another empire has an outpost or colony on it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip112Title">The circles underneath a system’s name represent planets! If they pulsate every few seconds, then they have a curiosity for you to search. If it has a rotating line around it, a faction is currently mining it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip113Title">When looking in the galaxy view, the box behind a system’s name represents its system level. If it has no border, it is level 1. If it has a bright border on the top and bottom, it is level 2. If it has a bright border on all edges, it is level 3. If it is completely filled in with a bright color, it is level 4.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip114Title">The more population you have, the higher the requirement to grow the next one, and the more food your system consumes. Make sure you invest in food or your empire will stagnate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip115Title">Ships kept in a system’s hangar will have less upkeep and heal faster, but can’t participate in any military operations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip116Title">It may be worthwhile to orbit an unused fleet around a special node. Some of them increase your vision range, give beneficial combat bonuses, or provide experience gain per turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip117Title">Be careful when invading a Vaulter [Vaulters] system, they have higher defensive power than most factions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip118Title">The Unfallen [Unfallen] have one crippling weakness, if you take an Unfallen system, then all vined systems connected to it will be detached from the vine network and die! Taking the Unfallen’s home system means a guaranteed death for the Unfallen player.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip119Title">If another faction has a system with an influence radius that covers your system, a great way to prevent them from converting it is by declaring war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip120Title">Remember, the Riftborn [TimeLords] can’t use food when creating outposts, instead, they value high industry-producing planets like Ash, Lava, or Burning Gas.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip121Title">New populations are grown once you have an accumulated stock of 300 food (scaling with game speed). Any food over this number is counted towards growing the next population, but you can only grow one population per turn, this can be bypassed with the population cloning buildin and otherwise there are technologies that will convert excess food stock into other resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip122Title">Mining Behemoths are great for gathering luxury and strategic resources that would otherwise be unavailable to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip123Title">The Hissho [MajorHisshos] have the ability to add a portion of the Fidsi [fidsi] on each planet they mine to every planet on their home system, allowing their single system to experience the growth of an entire empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip124Title">Science Behemoths are great for achieving a Science Victory, and can be used to lower the science costs of technologies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip125Title">The Academy [Academy] will grant its benefactors roles with powerful bonuses... to those who can win his auction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip126Title">The cost of technologies will slowly increase as you research more, Make sure you pick what you research first wisely. (this doesn't apply to technologies over the ammount required to unlock the next tier)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip127Title">Systems can store up to one turn of Industry [Industrycolored], If you forget to queue up something to build, or you start on something that doesn't take industry to build, you'll be able to use it next turn!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip128Title">You can store up to one turn of Science, [Sciencecolored] This means that if you forget to queue a technology for a turn, you won't take any penalties! This also means that any Science earned through destroying ships is lost if you earn more than you naturally produce per turn!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip129Title">Don't Forget to boost your pop!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip130Title">Independent [Politics] laws need to be unlocked by doing elections like any other party, the election result doesn't matter to them though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip131Title">Gas giants [Telluric] give the most Fidsi [fidsi] per pop, but suffer from a lack of pop slots and approval penalties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip132Title">The United Empire starts out industrialist [industrialist] but can pivot mid match to a Scientist [Scientist] or Militarist [Militarist] empire by completing their quest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip133Title">Hero [Hero] Skills come in four types, Labour [MasteryLabour] which increases system yields on the system they're assigned on, Wit [MasteryWit] increases Empire yields on the system they're assigned on, Curiosity [MasteryCuriosity] increases a fleet's overal exploration power and Command [MasteryCommand] increases your fleets combat power.</LocalizationPair>
