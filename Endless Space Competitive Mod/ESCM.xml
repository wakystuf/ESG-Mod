[h1]Overview[/h1]
[h2]Academy Rework[/h2]
[list]
[*] The ships of the Spear and all Academy ships in general now have obvious crippling weaknesses, and Academy fleets including the Spear start much smaller in general. They have no plating defense and no kinetic slugs, as well as focusing on energy weaponry, and mounting bombers and bomber-boosting modules instead of guns in some slots. This makes them very weak to small attacker missile spam, while the bombers let them still be somewhat useful through midgame. The Spear should be killable while alone if you counter-build it, while still being useful if you bring your own military along.
[*] All the roles of the Academy have been given passive bonuses to buff less useful roles and keep the Spear role relevant into lategame. The Librarian can research techs one stage higher and gains a large amount of hacking speed, the Master of Dust can make many diplomatic deals for free, the Vault Keeper has an increase to their influence bubble increases, and the Spear has a small fleet damage boost per military era.
[*] The Academy will no longer siege or blockade neutral systems or colonize new systems, and has much less powerful fleets in the earlygame.
[/list]

[h2]Behemoths[/h2]
[list]
[*] Economic Behemoth modules have been reworked. They no longer provide any Science or Dust, but increased flat Food and Industry bonuses. The upgraded module no longer provides any FIDS percentage bonuses, instead providing -5% industry cost on structures. This stacks up to -95%, and does not affect Wonders. This should make the use of Economic Behemoths more interesting, as they make setting up new colonies very quick, but you have to move them to the frontier thus exposing them to attack. If you leave them sitting on your home system, they quickly stop being useful.
[*] Military Behemoths now have targeting weights and the Focus trait, and all Behemoths are now stackable within fleets. They will now focus-fire with the rest of your fleet rather than spreading their fire randomly across the whole enemy fleet, and be properly targeted by the enemy while within a fleet. This should make them quite a bit more useful. Ion Wave now costs 25 of each tier 2 and tier 3 strategic resource to fire, as Juggernauts are now actually useful for their guns and because you're generally using Ion Wave to kill strategic-equipped fleets, so a small strategic cost is appropriate.
[*] Behemoths other than Citadels are now scrappable, so if you really want to get rid of one you can.
[/list]

[h2]Factions[/h2]
[list]
[*] Vodyani Leeching and All Must Provide modules other than the starting ones have been nerfed, to reduce their explosive rate of expansion past early-game. Leeching modules now also provide significant essence per CP destroyed in battle, encouraging you to risk losing them in combat. Means of gaining essence other than leeching and Ark modules have been buffed, such as the Essence Tribute Minor Faction diplomacy action, Alms for Essence, and Word of the Saints pacific conversion.
[*] Hissho mining probes other than the starting ones have had their FIDS percentages significantly reduced.
[*] Lumeris have an inherent 30% buyout cost reduction and their colonization cost is no longer affected by inflation, as well as Trade Companies in general being significantly buffed. Their quest reward laws Pay It Forward and Safer Streets have been changed to independant party laws, and Safer Streets now provides +1 colonization cap per trading company rather than +15 happiness on systems with trading companies. Jenes now has a Dust Ruins anomaly, and they start with Xenobiology instead of Rare Earth Foams.
[*] Horatio's starting planet now starts with a Komatite Volcano anomaly (+4 industry per pop) so he can actually build things earlygame and take advantage of the first Ecologists law, and he starts with Pulsos and Bhagaba minor faction pops instead of Zvali. One of the defense slots on their attacker has been changed to a defense/support slot.
[*] Unfallen Vineships have had their movment and vining speed buffed, their production cost reduced, and Unfallen Scouts have an additional support slot for another engine or probe so they can more easily find other factions to make peace with. They also start with a Molten Springs (+3 industry and +2 dust per pop) anomaly, for much the same reason as Horatio. Rather than starting with the Planetary Landscaping tech unlocked, they start with Xenolinguistics, as there is zero reason for them to start with basic food production buildings given their major population traits and their home system. Unfallen quest weapon modules have also been buffed.
[*] Umbral Choir's Burning Metal law has been whacked with the nerfbat to make it harder to break the hacking game with obscene amounts of hacking speed from backdoors. Their unique module, the Overcloaker, has been similarly nerfed as it was far too powerful.
[*] Riftborn civilian transport ships have had their speed increased by 2, to counteract their slow movement faction trait and make the pop management critical to high-level Riftborn play less painful. Stasis Singularities cost more strategics, to make them harder to spam. Their Hunter's lone defense slot has been changed to a defense/support slot, allowing it to run 2 engines at the cost of being even more fragile. They also start with a Dense Atmosphere anomaly, to guarantee their starting hero's anomaly-related skills will be useful. Singularites now no longer drain all system industry for the turn, as Riftborn have far too many queue-blockers for their play to be smooth.
[*] Sophons now get their Omniscience boost when researching their ship techs, and a particular sticking point on their military quest path has been made easier.
[*] United Empire now gains +100% influence on empire, as their main game mechanic was simply not useful enough. They have also had their per-pop bonuses buffed. Imperials now provide +1 Influence +1 Industry, Mezari now provide +1 Influence +1 Science, and Sheredyn now provide +1 Influence +20 manpower capacity. They now start with a High-Energy Plasmasphere anomaly on Raia, to smooth out their earlygame science problems. Their exploration ship has one of their weapon modules changed to a weapon/support module, and their attacker has one of their defense slots changed to defense/support. Their quest requirements and rewards have been tweaked, most notably having Scifi Design Schools now being an empire trait rather than a building.
[*] Vaulter ships have had most of their dedicated support slots changed to support/defense slots, so their ships can potentially be much bulkier at the cost of movement speed and utility. The cost to use strategics instead of luxuries for system developments has been reduced, as it was so high as to be unfeasible.
[*] Cravers have new options after winning a ground battle; their Pillage action allows them to kidnap population, and their Raze option gives them a moderate amount of Influence, Science, and Dust while applying depletion points to the affected system. Their quest rewards have been tweaked to make the choices less of a no-brainer.
[*] Nakalim have been significantly reworked. Their population production, population collection bonuses, and quest rewards have been significantly altered, and they now have several new faction-specific buildings.
[*] Many useless minor faction traits have been buffed, such as Bhagaba's pacific conversion resistance being changed to an influence per food trait, and Tikanan/Gnashast infantry buff traits now apply to all troop types but less so.
[/list]

[h2]Luxuries[/h2]
The effects of luxuries and system developments have been reworked. The FIDSI boost has been partially shifted onto the system development level itself, reducing the power difference between different luxury types, in order to make the outcome of the game less decided by who spawns with Jadonyx. System developments also provide a system vision radius increase, to better allow for defensive ship refitting, and a small amount of bandwidth, to make protecting large empires from hacking slightly easier. This rework is toggleable.

[h2]Terraforming[/h2]
The cost of terraforming has been significantly reduced, to make it a more viable option. Multiple toggles have been added to optionally allow free terraforming both up and down planet types, planet size terraforming, gas giant terraforming, and unique planet terraforming. Behemoth Terraformation has been temporarily disabled to prevent crashes.

[h2]Diplomacy and Politics[/h2]
[list]
[*] Trade and Science agreements now cost a flat 50 influence per turn instead of 2 influence per pop.
[*] Factions now start with a small amount of influence, enough to be able to pass a party law on turn one.
[*] The effects of some laws have been tweaked, for example Dirty Hands Act has been slightly buffed from 10%(15%) to 15%(20%) as the cost decrease was not reducing the number of turns several key buildings take to build in certain situations. Cram Exam is now available from turn 1 for Republics, as it is critical to earlygame science generation for Lumeris.

[h2]Hero Skills[/h2]
Many hero skills have been buffed, nerfed, or tweaked. In particular, Hero class skills have been added; Seekers now have exploration traits on their ship, Guardian ships have Focus Fire, Counselors now give +1 Dust/Science per population, and Overseers now give +1 Food/Industry per population. Counselor skills have been reworked and buffed.

[h2]Inflation[/h2]
The inflation equation has been altered to significantly reduce the effects of inflation in lategame scenarios. Inflation scales upwards much slower, and the scaling slows down as more and more dust is produced. This should make dust-heavy factions and strategies more viable later on in the game.

[h2]Galaxies, Sliders, and Customization[/h2]
[list]
[*] Population stock growth amount now scales slightly with system population count to make food buildings and technologies more relevant.
[*] Fewer 1 and 2 planet systems will be generated.
[*] Toxic planets are now called Swamp planets and have been made less terrible.
[*] Sliders have been added for the number of curiosities, anomalies, unique anomalies, luxury types, unique planets, and many more, allowing for an unparalleled level of galaxy customization.
[*] A PvP hacking toggle has been added, preventing hacking outcomes other than backdoors and sleepers against major factions.
[*] The Minor Faction amount slider has been made more granular, ranging from 0 to 8 minor factions per player.
[/list]

[h2]Modules[/h2]
[list]
[*] Squadrons have been made faster so they can actually reach their targets well before the first phase ends, preventing scenarios where gun fleets that should be countered by squadron fleets would just kill the squadron fleets with their entire phase of free damage. Bombers have been nerfed to bring their power in line with other weapon options, and fighter behaviour has been tweaked to make them more functional.
[*] Swarm Missile fire rate is now properly changable, preventing their DPS from being quadrupled by Heavy Mounts rather than properly doubled.
[*] Lock-On modules have been buffed to 6% per CP for Antimatter and 10% per CP for Quadrinix, preventing them from being obsoleted by the corresponding Strike Multiplier modules.
[*] Core Cracker cost has been significantly decreased, but fleets with Core Crackres can no longer be cloaked.
[*] Ship and flotilla shield capacity now scales with ship level. Flotilla shields now scale with module multiplier. Shield Reloaders have been reworked to be useful, and a new Shield Regenerator module that regenraties shields on the entire flotilla have been added.
[*] Reactive plating has had the Fleet XP per damage absorbed removed, as it was leveling up heroes way too quickly.
[*] Slugs have had their accuracy buffed to 25%/50%/100% at Long/Medium/Short range.
[*] Targeting priorities have been fixed for weapons that overwrite the default targeting priorities, so that, for example, the Gjallerfire will now actually shoot at Behemoths rather than doing nothing.
[/list]

[h2]Combat[/h2]
[list]
[*] Air Troops have had their health reduced to 150, as they were mathematically strictly superior to other options.
[*] Targeting priorities for most ships have been tweaked to be smarter.
[*] The AI should now build its ships slightly more intelligently, and properly use Flak to counter Boarding Pods.
[*] The Battle Morale effect has been buffed to +10% accuracy, +5% damage, and +10% evasion for each lane that you are uncontested in.
[/list]

[h2]Buildings[/h2]
[list]
[*] Drone Networks has been buffed to 15/15 Food/Industry.
[*] Sustainable Farms has been buffed to 10/10/10 Food per Planet/Cold/Hot.
[*] ITER's cost has been changed to 15/15 Antimatter/Adamantian, as it was too easy to jump straight from building Endless Research Park to ITER.
[/list]

[h2]Custom Factions[/h2]
Many, many, many new traits and options have been added for you to play around with, such as the ability to start on sterile planets or gas giants, the ability to start with a specialized Behemoth, Make Trade Not War which prevents war declaration, and too many more to individually list.
